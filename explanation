What Does This Code Do?
It’s essentially a single-page web application (SPA).
It allows users to:
• View a landing page and switch over to a “main app view”.
• Configure a mini-tournament by selecting start time, end time, match duration, number of fields, etc.
• Sign up multiple teams in different categories (Mikro, Mini, Lillegutt/jente).
• “Generate schedule” based on constraints like day, pool sizes, and time slots.
• Filter the generated schedule by day, category, or team.
The script also handles theming (light/dark) using localStorage.
There is an inline chat/assistant interface (the “Jimini Chat”) that shows or hides a chat modal.
The code includes logic to:
• Separate teams into “pools” and generate round-robin matchups within each pool.
• Ensure minimal breaks between matches.
• Constrain certain leagues’ matches to specific days (e.g., “Mikro” only on Saturday, “Lillegutt/jente” only on Sunday).
Overall, this file is an all-in-one HTML + JS + Tailwind (from a CDN) approach.
Key Suggestions for Improvement
Below are some ideas for organizing and prepping this for a smoother deployment to Vercel, as well as improving maintainability and reliability:
Separate Your Files:
Instead of a single massive HTML file, consider factoring out the JS code into a dedicated script.js and any custom CSS into styles.css (or a Tailwind CSS build).
Vercel is very friendly to static sites with separate files; it doesn’t require you to keep everything inlined.
Use Tailwind Locally (Optional but Recommended):
Right now, you’re loading Tailwind from a CDN. This is fine for a small prototype, but for a production deployment, you can set up a local Tailwind build (e.g., via a minimal npm + postcss config) to tree-shake unused styles and reduce your bundle size.
If you prefer no build step, you can keep the CDN reference—but it can slow down time-to-interactive and is not always the best for production.
Remove Unused Elements and References:
In your “DOMContentLoaded” event listeners, you reference variables like landingChatSendBtn, landingChatInput, etc., which don’t appear to exist in the HTML. Clean these up or implement the missing elements to avoid console errors.
Extract Configuration/Translations:
You have quite a large translations object in JS. If you plan to expand or localize further, moving these into a JSON file or another structure might be clearer.
It would also make it easier to add or change translations without touching logic.
Check For Edge Cases in Scheduling Logic:
You have code that sorts matches by day (Saturday vs. Sunday) and sets constraints. Make sure you handle user input mistakes robustly. You might, for instance, want to show a friendlier error in the UI if a user tries to pick a start day that is not Saturday, or if the user attempts to finalize a schedule with fewer than 2 teams.
Provide a Fallback or Real Data Storage:
Teams, schedules, and settings are stored in memory in the browser. If you want this to be persistent or multi-user, you’ll eventually need a backend or a serverless function to store data across sessions.
For now, if this is purely client-side, clarify that data resets upon page refresh.
Deploy as a Static Site:
Because it’s a simple SPA with no server-side code, you likely can follow these steps on Vercel:
Create a new folder (e.g., “app”) in your repository.
Put this file in that folder as “index.html”.
Optionally, split out the JavaScript into “index.js” and reference it in “index.html”.
In Vercel’s project settings, point the build output to that folder.
That’s it—Vercel will detect it as a static project and serve it automatically.
Use Strict Mode and ESLint:
Turning on ESLint or a similar tool helps catch variable shadowing, missing semicolons, etc.
JavaScript “strict mode” can be enabled with "use strict"; at the top of your script.
Add a 404.html or a Redirect:
If you plan to do client-side routing (or if there’s any chance a user might land on a path like “/schedule” directly), you’ll want a simple 404 page or a fallback.
For a single static file, this may not be necessary, but it’s a good practice.
Conclusion
Your single-page “Minirundeplanlegger” does a nice job of letting people configure a small tournament, sign up teams, and generate a schedule. For deploying to Vercel:
• You can keep it simple by committing an index.html (and possibly a separate JS file) to your repo.
• Configure Vercel to serve that directory as a static site.
• (Optional) Add a Tailwind build if you want a lighter CSS bundle or more customization.
By factoring the script into its own file, removing dead references, and optionally adding a build step for Tailwind, you’ll have a smoother developer experience and a more maintainable codebase.
